#calculator4

In addtion to features calculator3 has, calculator4 supports unary function call.

For example:

+ x=sqrt(2);
+ y=log(x);
+ exp(log(233));

See more examples in input.

These functions also are variables, so they are stored in var table.

In calculator4, I only adds these three functions: "sqrt", "log", "exp".

But you can add more unary functions in main(). // see cal.y for more detail.
